**[FREEDOM SLIDE - TITLE]**

- - -

## What’s the meaning of life? For me, **FREEDOM**

**Pursuing freedom is all about your investment of TIME & CAPITAL**

AND THE CRITICAL POINT IS YOU ARE **ALREADY RICH!!!!**

**[YOU’RE ALREADY RICH SLIDE]**

You are **RICH IN TIME** - short on capital

**BUT YOUR INVESTING JOURNEY STARTS TODAY WITH HOW YOU ALLOCATE YOUR TIME AS WELL AS YOUR CAPITAL.**

So, my talk today is in 2 havles, 1 about how you might consider allocating your time and the other on how to look at allocating capital.

First, thing - please follow the principle of **SIMPLIFICATION** 
- how many really important decisions that affect my future freedom am I making today
- Goldman Sachs on/in business story

ALLOCATE WITH CLARITY
ALLOCATE WITH SIMPLICITY
ALLOCATE WITH **CONSISTENCY**

On the basis of simplicity and consistency let’s touch on **COMPOUND INTEREST** and its power.

Story of **SISSA** - **18 quintillion grains of rice, 368 trillion tonnes**

But it can work against you - more on that later

- - -
**[A LONG AND WINDING ROAD SLIDE]**


## Worked example: how I tried to invest my TIME CAPITAL and what I got right and wrong

- was expected to be a banker - went to barrister
- started a co in late 1990s to bring creative industry talent online, raised £3.5m
- Geek interface - tech representative to non-tech people
- **BUT! No freedom, 1-70 staff in 18 months, aggressive shareholders who forced us to sell**

- Then, thought “proper” job in finance - UK based long-only, value fund in US small & mid-cap equities
- Practical MBA - pre online, 10K 10Qs, direct contact with management
- **BUT! No freedom becuase no tech (after dotcom bust) so no opportunity to focus on the sector I understood most so time allocation was wrong**

- Saw coming personal and residential tech wave - pre iPhone - became a national resi and commerical systems integration company
- Ran it for 7 years, multi-£m turnover 
- Organically funded - no external shareholders
- **BUT! No freedom because my allocation of time and capital was with my partner who had different motivations**

- Sold my share to found a venture-backed IoT and ML company focussing on optimising environmental efficiency 
- **BUT! Again, limited freedom from**
  - **deferred compensation** 
  - **founder answering to aggressive shareholders**
  - **enterprise customers**
  - **complex partnerships in insurance**
  - **motivating stressed staff**

- Finally became MD of an established environmental VC fund
- FCA regulated
- **BUT! Freedom massively curtailed by regulator! Shut us down during COVID because they didn’t want to understand our business**

HOWEVER - very good to RUN a P&L, EMPLOY STAFF AND UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE EXECUTIVES ARE UNDER

- - -
**[DON’T TRAP YOUR CAPITAL SLIDE]**


## Over-riding conclusion: value LIQUIDITY - freedom to change your investments 

- It’s so important that when you allocate time and particualry capital that you can extract it if events require you to
- In so many of the examples above I was tied into massively illiquid investments - and there is little more illiquid than a founder’s capital and time!

- BUT, DURING THESE YEARS I’d been investing on the side and it became clear to me that there were areas where I could scale in, test my thesis and stay liquid so…

- - -
**[UNFAIR ADVANTAGES SLIDE]**


## So that brought me to the realisation you need to identify & double down on your UNFAIR ADVANTAGES!

- Which is to say - invest in your passions, places where you have more knowledge than most
- i.e. places where you have an unfair advantage!
- While I was struggling through the experiences above I was investing
  - Organised Bitcoin dinners in 2011 because it was tech meets finance!
  - Invested in the Ethereum ICO (sold it all to go to a stag in Vegas - bad investment decision!)
  - Tesla from 2014 as I was a passionate car nut and wanted to know if it could really change the world (& in case of doubt Model Y best selling car in world last 2 years!)

- So it wasn’t just my passion for finance, cars and tech
- But also my training: History MA: primary sources
- Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory build Jan 2019 - models off line in December

- - -
**[LIQUIDITY & OPPORTUNITY SLIDE]**


## So, while you’re TIME RICH keep simplicity & liquidity in mind and run your capital investing alongside

- became clear that for SIMPLICITY, LIQUIDITY and the variety to exercise my UNFAIR ADVANTAGES the **PUBLIC MARKETS** were vital for my investing
- They are LIQUID
- VARIED
- NOT ZERO SUM
- and offer extremely HIGH RETURNS
- PRACTICAL - build readily accessible wealth that directly contributes to your freedom of choices

**KICKSTART YOUR CAPITAL INVESTING WITH COMPOUNDING**

- START NOW: **£15 per month**
- increase that by **15% each year**
- try to compound at **15% per year** +/-
- By the time you’re my age you will have **£750k**
- By retirement at 65 you’ll have almost **£10m**

- - -

## So, turning to the mechanics of CAPITAL INVESTING, where are we now?

- in the midst of a grand ponzi scheme - how so?
- YESTERDAY’S DEBT IS UNPAYABLE TODAY, AND NEEDS MORE FROM TOMORROW

**[JUST THE WAY IT IS SLIDE]**

Here’s why:

**[4 CHART SLIDE]**

- US Working Age pop declining so fewer economically productive people to support the nation
- Birth rate is falling (also across other Western developed and indebted economies)
- Total debt as % of GDP rising
- And real GDP is falling

YIKES!

**[LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE SLIDE]**

- Understandable: labour down, debt required up

**[CAPEX VS DEBT ROLL SLIDE]**

- Problem because if an economy is not allocating capital to capex, which should create a positive ROIC but instead spends it servicing debt then it can’t grow itself out of the issue

So what happens from here? **GLOBAL GOVERMENTS WILL RELEASE MORE LIQUIDITY**

- they can’t not because the system collapses if the debt doesn’t roll over
- almost happened in GFC
- $9 trillion to roll in US alone this year
- Will ultimately lead to monetary debasement which has been averaging 9.5% per year since 2000 if you look at M2 of US, China, Eurozone and Japan
- This means **YOU HAVE TO BEAT 9.5% PER YEAR TO MAINTAIN YOUR PURCHASING POWER**
- To give you some perspective if you have £1000 now that debasement will give you £8.47 of purchasing power by 2050.

**THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT! YOU CAN’T AVOID RISK AND HOLD CASH, OR BONDS OR INDEED ANYTHING THAT WON’T APPRECIATE AT MORE THAN 9.5% AND BE “SAFE”**

In fact your decision to allocate your time to a job SHOULD BE QUESTIONED if you don’t get a 10% pay rise every year!

I told you that compounding was powerful!

Why do they keep debasing? Because they can’t service the debts if they don’t

**[GMI US TOTAL LIQUIDITY SLIDE]**

So this is our investing backdrop and we have to take advantage of it.

**[SCARCITY, GROWTH & VALUE SLIDE]**

## What to buy?

- Broadly there are 3 types of assets to buy
  - SCARCE: gold, Bitcoin
  - GROWTH: owning equities is about owning future cashflows
  - VALUE: the Buffett way! Harder now but finding hidden gems
- If you choose wisely you can beat the debasement:
  - GOLD is level at 9.5% compounded since the GFC
  - DAX at 11%
  - SPX at 12%
  - NASDAQ at 19%
  - BTC at 157%!
  - Beware FTSE All Share at 5%
  - Clearly gilts/treasury bonds etc woefully less
- Use your unfair advantages to do better! Find the Dominos Pizza, Apple, Tesla, Nvidia or Bitcoin/Ethereum/Solana trades that you understand and feel confident in

**[CROSSBORDER GLI TO BTC 6-WEEK CHANGE SLIDE]**

So it’s important to ensure you are well allocated to those assets that can **REALLY OUTPERFORM** and raise performance above debasement.

**[GMI NASDAQ & BTC CORRELATION SLIDE]**

BUT HOW CAN WE BEAT THE PROs?

YOUR ADVANTAGES:
- NO TIME CONSTRAINT - they’re 1-3 months
- NO RISK MANAGER
- NO REGULATOR

YOUR DISADVANTAGES:
- MUCH LESS DATA
- LESS STRUCTURE AND COMMENTARY
- NO SAFETY NET

MITIGATIONS:
- UNPRECEDENTED DEMOCRATISED INFO ON
  - TWITTER (primary sources!)
  - SUBSTACK
  - YOUTUBE
- COMMUNITIES
  - REALVISION
  - INVESTING CLUBS LIKE THIS

- - -
**[KNOW THYSELF SLIDE]**

## But you have to be very self-aware

CONTROL YOUR PSYCHOLOGY

- OPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST?
- CAN YOU HANDLE DRAWDOWNS?
- in the main I’d advise AVOIDING TRADING:
  - it’s NOT SIMPLE
  - NULLIFIES TIMEFRAME ADVANTAGE vs pros
  - it’s very hard to be consistent

MY FINAL TIP: THE BARBELL STRATEGY

**[BARBELL SLIDE]**

Where you aim for less volatile, less correlated assets on one end and then the rocket fuel on the other. 

Keep it small - don’t forget diversification does not help build life-changing wealth.

**THANK YOU!!!**
